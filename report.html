            <!-- Accessibility -->
<div class="section-box animated fadeIn">
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Accessibility is a cornerstone of my website design philosophy. I believe that a website should be usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This approach not only broadens the audience who can interact with my content but also aligns with best practices and ethical standards in web development. To ensure that my portfolio is accessible, I have implemented several key strategies:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Semantic HTML:</strong> One of the foundational aspects of accessibility on my site is the use of semantic HTML. By employing semantic tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, I ensure that the structure of the content is logical and meaningful. This is crucial for screen readers used by visually impaired individuals, as these tools rely on semantic HTML to understand and navigate through a webpage effectively. For instance, headings are properly ordered from <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>, allowing screen readers to present the content hierarchy accurately. This not only improves the experience for users with disabilities but also enhances the overall structure and SEO of the website.
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
            <strong>High Contrast and Readability:</strong> To accommodate users with visual impairments, including color blindness, I have carefully selected a color scheme that provides high contrast between text and background elements. This ensures that text is readable and visually distinct from other content on the page. Additionally, I have paid special attention to font size, type, and spacing, making sure that all text is large enough to be easily read without strain. The combination of large, clear fonts and high-contrast colors helps prevent eye strain and improves the user experience for those with low vision or other visual challenges. I have also tested the site with various color contrast tools to ensure it meets the recommended accessibility standards, such as the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
            <strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> Recognizing that not all users interact with websites using a mouse or touchpad, I have ensured that all interactive elements on my site, including links, buttons, forms, and navigation menus, are fully accessible via keyboard. This feature is particularly important for users with motor disabilities, who may rely on keyboards, assistive switches, or voice commands to navigate the web. I have implemented focus states that are clearly visible, allowing users to see where they are on the page when tabbing through elements. This includes making sure that all interactive elements can be reached in a logical order and that dropdown menus, forms, and other complex interactions are fully operable without a mouse.
        </li>
        <br></br>
    </ul>

    <p>These efforts reflect my commitment to creating an inclusive web experience that respects and accommodates the needs of all users.
